import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import { BrowserRouter as Router } from "react-router-dom"; // Import BrowserRouter or HashRouter

import App from "./App"; // Your main application component

ReactDOM.render(
  <Router>
    <App />
  </Router>,
  document.getElementById("root")
);
// Ensure that you have imported BrowserRouter or HashRouter and wrapped your App component with it.

// If you have already set up the router correctly and are still encountering this error, please provide more details about your component hierarchy and how you're using react-router-dom so that I can offer more specific guidance.
